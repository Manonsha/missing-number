#Missing Number Finder
This Java program finds the missing number in a sequence of consecutive natural numbers. It assumes that one number is missing from the complete sequence.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Takes an array of numbers from the user.

Calculates the missing number from the series.

Uses mathematical formula for efficiency.

ðŸ’» How to Run
Save the code in a file named missingNumber.java.

Open any Java IDE or use a terminal/command prompt with JDK installed.

Compile the program using:
javac missingNumber.java
Run the program:
java missingNumber
Input the elements as prompted (excluding the missing number).

ðŸ“Ž Example
Enter the number of elements to be added : 4  
1  
2  
4  
5  
The missing number is 3
ðŸ§  Logic Explanation
The sum of first n natural numbers is given by:
(nâˆ—(n+1))/2

Since one number is missing, we use n + 1 in the formula.

Subtract the sum of the user-entered numbers from the expected sum to get the missing number.
